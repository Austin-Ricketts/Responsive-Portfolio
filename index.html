                My name is Austin. I bring my experience as an educator, chaplain and pastor, and my training in Religion and Biblical Studies, to the work of guiding others along their spiritual journeys.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for the big questions, I’ve asked them all: Does God exist? Is God good? What makes a life meaningful? What makes an action ethical? Is there one truth to be found, or a plurality of truths? What is love?
            </p>
            <p>
                My life’s work is to explore these questions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve done so as an academic. I hold a BA in Biblical Studies and an MA in Religion, and this training has put me in conversation with millennia of thinkers across traditions who have asked the questions before me.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class=col-lg-9></div>
            <p>
                I’ve done so as a pastor and chaplain, meeting with individuals and learning about their experiences, studying the spiritual life as if it were a science, probing the Divine nature as I observe the torque and force of the Divine spirit moving in others.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve done so as a mystic. I’ve drawn upon the spiritual disciplines of the Protestant Christian tradition in which I was raised, and the contemplative practices of Quakerism, Catholicism, the Orthodox Church, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Daoism.
            </p>
            <p>
                In all of this, I am learning to discern the still, small voice of God. Through my own journey, spurred by curiosity and crises, I have learned to see the golden thread of transcendence, and I offer spiritual guidance to others from the measure of Light that I’ve been given.
            </p>
            <p>
                I live in Philadelphia with my wife Catherine. When I’m not geeking out over a book, article, or online lecture, I’m taking in the city’s art, architecture, and film, getting a beer with a friend, or gathering people at our place for good food and conversation.
